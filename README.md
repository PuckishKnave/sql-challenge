# sql-challenge
During this SQL challenge my aim was to create and ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) utilizing some provided CSV files which are located in the Resources folder within this repository. I then used the ERD tool's (https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) export function to create a SQL file containing the schemata for the tables relating to the CSV files. My next goal was to do analysis on the database laid out in the schemata.sql file to answer a set of questions about the data. The queries.sql file is where my main analysis is done in order to display the following information:  
1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.  

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.  

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.  

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.  

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."  

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.  

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.  

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
